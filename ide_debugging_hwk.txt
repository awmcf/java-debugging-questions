What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

A breakpoint stops our application at a specific point so that we can dissect and check how a particular line of code is running.

Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

No, it stops at the line of code that the breakpoint is put on.

How do we debug the next line of code?

"Step Over"

What does the step into command do?

Goes to the method that is used in the test and allows us to test it by stepping over it.

What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

Code fragment mode lets you evaluate multiple lines of code, evaluate expression lets you just evaluate one line of code, one expression.
